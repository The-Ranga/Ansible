Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for:

Configuration management
Application deployment
Task automation
IT orchestration

It allows you to manage servers, networks, cloud, and containers easily — without installing any agent on the managed machines.

Key Features Description:

Agentless	No software/agent required on client nodes. Uses SSH or WinRM.
YAML-based	Playbooks written in simple YAML — human-readable.
Idempotent	Running a task multiple times won’t cause repeated changes.
Cross-platform	Works on Linux, Unix, Windows, cloud, containers, etc.
Scalable	Manage a few or thousands of servers with ease.

Common Ansible Use Cases:

Provisioning: Setup virtual machines, cloud infra (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure).
Configuration Management: Install packages, manage files, users, services.
Application Deployment: Automate code deployment (e.g., Java, Python apps).
Orchestration: Coordinate multiple servers and services in sequence.
Security Automation: Apply patches, compliance settings.

How Ansible Works:

Inventory file → defines the list of target hosts (like a list of servers).
Playbooks → YAML files describing tasks and configurations.
Modules → Reusable units that perform actual actions (e.g., yum, copy, service).
SSH/WinRM → Connects to systems and runs tasks remotely.

You write code once (in YAML), and Ansible does the rest — over SSH!
